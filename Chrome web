This document will guide you through the process of setting up the API integration with the Postman
API Platform. By using Postman you can accelerate the design, mocking, and testing of your scripts to
make the process easier than ever to use Chrome Browser Cloud Management APIs. By using Cloud
management APIs, you can push and pull data into the console at scale and enhance the level of
reporting that you can gather from your enrolled browsers. This document assumes the following:
● Have access to the Google admin console
● A super admin account for the setup
● At least one (or more) device(s) enrolled into Chrome Browser Cloud Management for testing
